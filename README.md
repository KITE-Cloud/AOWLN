# AOWLN Visualiser
This work proposes a graphical visualisation for SWRL rules that we call Aided OWL Notation (AOWLN).
For practical application, we implemented an AOWLN Visualiser as a Java-based prototypical Protégé Plugin.
For practical application, we implemented a prototypical AOWLN Visualiser tool as a Java-based Protégé Plugin.

To install the plugin you have to follow two steps. 
1. Download the Plugin:

The plugin can be downloaded in two ways. 
You can find the plugin directly via the auto-update function of the Protege Ontology Editor. You will always find the latest version there, which has been published by us. 
If you want to install an older version you can do this directly via our Github Repository (Kite-Cloud/AOWLN). Under the tab realeases you will find all published Jars.

2. start the plugin

To start the plugin you first have to load an additional jar out of our repository. This will take care of generating the rule images. 
The newest version is always accessible under the following link: 
https://github.com/KITE-Cloud/AOWLN/tree/master/setup

After you have downloaded the file, open the tab AOWLN-Tab. This can be found under:
Window -> Tabs -> AOWLN-Tab

the plugin will then ask you for the AOWLN-image-engine.jar. Use the File-Explorer to link them and click on the button "Continue". 

The plugin is now ready and can be used to visualize your SWRL rules.
